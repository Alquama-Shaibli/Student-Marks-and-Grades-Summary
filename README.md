# Student-Marks-and-Grades-Summary


Designing a Python program to calculate and summarize student marks and grades using basic  programming concepts.


# Grading System (Marks out of 100 per subject):

A1: 91–100 (Grade Point 10)

A2: 81–90 (Grade Point 9)

B1: 71–80 (Grade Point 8)

B2: 61–70 (Grade Point 7)

C1: 51–60 (Grade Point 6)

C2: 41–50 (Grade Point 5)

D: 33–40 (Grade Point 4)

E (Fail): 0–32

# How it works:

For each student:

~Input name and marks in 3 subjects

1-Calculate total, average, and grade according to your detailed criteria

2-Output each student's marks, total, average, and grade

3-Print class average and topper (highest average, not "Fail")
